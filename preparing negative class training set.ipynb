       "'senior police officer says the post-mortem report suggested that the cause of death is unnatural. A senior police officer said the post-mortem report suggested that the cause of death was unnatural, after which a case under section 302 (Punishment for murder) has been registered at the Defence Colony Police Station. The case was transferred to the Crime Branch for investigation. Rohit was found unconscious with his nose bleeding on Tuesday afternoon. His house staff informed his mother, after which he was rushed to thehospital where he was declared brought dead. PTI adds: Rohit died died due to strangulation: autopsy report Rohit Shekhar Tiwari, son of late Uttarakhand Chief Minister N.D. Tiwari, died of “asphyxia” as he was strangulated, according to the autopsy report. Following a postmortem examination at AIIMS here, police have registered a case of murder and transferred it to the Crime Branch for investigation. The autopsy was conducted by a medical board, comprising five senior doctors of AIIMS. “The medical board unanimously concluded that the cause of death in this case is asphyxia as a result of strangulation and smothering. It is a sudden unnatural death, placed in the category of homicide,” the head of the AIIMS’ forensic department, Dr. Sudhir Gupta, said. The case has been transferred to the Crime Branch and it has started investigating the matter, a senior officer said. Crime Branch officers visited Tiwari’s residence on Friday and questioned his family members and domestic helps, police said. The officers are also going through CCTV footage in and around the house to find leads and to ascertain the sequence of events leading to the death.
